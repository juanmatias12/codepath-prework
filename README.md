This is not a professional network building app like linkedin but more of a social app to meet people currently in a similiar situation as yourself

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Instagram
    -stories
    -direct messaging
    -sharing content
- Tiktok
    -sharing content
    -direct messaging
    -following creators
-Youtube
    -wathing creators
    -ability to use while phone is locked
    -thumbnails
    
-Twitch Clips
    On twitch you are able to watch your favorite streamers stream or their past broadcasts. You can also watch some of their clips but it is in horizontal format,boring. With twitch clips you can have a seperate tab where you can watch vertical content of your favorite streamers, games etc. Now some might say "well that's what tiktoks for" but tiktok isn't just for gaming or streaming content. There's far too much content on tiktok so why not have a feature similiar to it on an app exclusively for gaming or other streaming content. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
